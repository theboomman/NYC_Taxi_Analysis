# NYC_Taxi_Analysis
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), established in 1971, regulates the cityâ€™s taxis and publishes millions of trip records for both yellow and green cabs. These records include details like trip times, locations, distances, fares, and passenger counts.
Yellow taxis, the city's iconic vehicles, can pick up passengers anywhere and are identified by a yellow medallion. Green taxis, introduced in 2013, serve designated areas to improve service in the boroughs. 
This report has revealed the analysis of trip records from the 2 taxi colors, which are parquet (.parquet) files. In these files, there are details of trip records that occurred from 2015-2022.
